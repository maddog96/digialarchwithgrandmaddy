            <br> For our second portfolio project, we were asked to create a project inspired by the theme “The Bones of Our Past”. Initially, I wanted to create something that was personalized to my family and ancestry. I brainstormed with my Dad and we decided it would be neat to create a digital narrative of the ship that my Great-Grandfather fought on during the First World War. My Great Grandfather, John Douglas Chater, was deployed on a ship called HMS Flirt. On the 27th of October, 1916, while the ship was attempting to stop the Germans from advancing further into the seas of Dover, the crew came across a wreckage where another British ship had been mined. My Great-Grandfather and 2 other men hopped into a safety boat to rescue some of the survivors out of the freezing Atlantic. While they were in the water, HMS flirt was torpedoed by Germans. The ship went down in 8 minutes and John Chater along with 5 other men were the only survivors out of the 60 person crew. <br><br> The information that I found on HMS Flirt was not sufficient enough to support an entire project, so I thought it would be best to broaden my topic. I decided to research ship wreckages in England that are from the First World War. Due to the fact that there are hundreds of wreckages, for the sake of this project, I narrowed it down to the WW1 warships of Dover that sunk between the years of 1914-1918. Even more specifically, the ships that are frequently explored by and available to divers. (Note: I did not include submarines or shipwrecks that did not belong to the British Navy). This project uses a digital map to show the approximate location of 13 war-shipwrecks in the seas of Dover, as well as a brief summary of their story. <br><br> Archaeologically, I find this to be an interesting and important topic due to the fact that underwater wreckages are often overlooked as they are not visible or accessible to many. I feel that shipwrecks should be analyzed more heavily as they are the burial sites of millions of people and are a source of so much information about human past.

              WOW. Within the past few weeks I have learned A LOT about coding and much quicker than I was anticipating. Initially, when I first signed up to Codecademy, the whole concept of coding felt pretty overwhelming. However, after I completed a few tutorials, I began to understand the process and the simplicity of the concept started to become clear. The Codecademy tutorials are very informative and even fun at times but I understand now that their exercises are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to coding. When we were tasked with building our own website, I again felt very in over my head. I managed to accomplish a few things on my site by myself such as insterting photos and adding/changing the text, however, these things took me hoooouuurrs to do and when I tried to do anything beyond that I was completely stumped. I couldn't figure out how to review the Codecademy tutorials so my site remained very similar to the original Bootstrap template. Until an angel by the name of Yip came to my rescue and showed me a few simple ways to personalize my site! After I was able to hide things from the orinigal template and re-size images, my site slowly began to come together. From there it was relatively smooth sailing aside from a few hiccups such as figuring out how to centre images (never figured it out as you can see by my "about" page) and how to utilize the "read more" option of this blog page (still don't know how). Overall I am MUCH more confident with coding and navigating my site. It is still not at all where I would like it to be but I am excited to keep working on it and adding to it throughout the term as I learn more new skills!

          It was very difficult to find a website that would openly share the locations of shipwrecks with the public. I assume that this secrecy is not only to keep the wrecks as undisturbed & respected burial sites, but also to inhibit the ability of people plundering the wrecks and selling their findings online. After a long search, I finally found a site that provided the approximate coordinates of all shipwrecks around the UK.

          HMT Angelus was comissioned for war in 1914 as an armed Admirality Trawler. She served as part of the Dover Patrol. On February 28, 1916, she struck a mine and sank. The wreck is currently in poor condition and lays approximately 127m beneath the sea just off the shore of Dover.

          SS Anglia was used as an auxiliary hospital ship. On November 17, 1915, the ship was on its way home with many victims of trench warfare. While Crossing the English Channel from france, SS Anglia struck a mine. There were about 50 survivors and in total 129 soldiers and crew were lost. The wreck lies in approximately 30m of water. Divers stress that this site must be treated with respect.
