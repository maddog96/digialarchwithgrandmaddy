              WOW. Within the past few weeks I have learned A LOT about coding and much quicker than I was anticipating. Initially, when I first signed up to Codecademy, the whole concept of coding felt pretty overwhelming. However, after I completed a few tutorials, I began to understand the process and the simplicity of the concept started to become clear. The Codecademy tutorials are very informative and even fun at times but I understand now that their exercises are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to coding. When we were tasked with building our own website, I again felt very in over my head. I managed to accomplish a few things on my site by myself such as insterting photos and adding/changing the text, however, these things took me hoooouuurrs to do and when I tried to do anything beyond that I was completely stumped. I couldn't figure out how to review the Codecademy tutorials so my site remained very similar to the original Bootstrap template. Until an angel by the name of Yip came to my rescue and showed me a few simple ways to personalize my site! After I was able to hide things from the orinigal template and re-size images, my site slowly began to come together. From there it was relatively smooth sailing aside from a few hiccups such as figuring out how to centre images (never figured it out as you can see by my "about" page) and how to utilize the "read more" option of this blog page (still don't know how). Overall I am MUCH more confident with coding and navigating my site. It is still not at all where I would like it to be but I am excited to keep working on it and adding to it throughout the term as I learn more new skills!
