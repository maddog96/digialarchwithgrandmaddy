        <p>  I chose to tell the story about the falling of the Aztec Empire as it is one that I have learned about it in another class and find to be particularly interesting. The construction of this project went rather smoothly in comparison to the first two. Like anything digital, Twine took me a little bit of time to get use to, but once I watched a couple tutorials, it was fairly easy to get the hang of. The one thing that took me the longest to figure out was how to add photos to the passages. I probably tried for 3 hours, numerous different ways to add photos but it just wasn't working. Eventually, I thought maybe it was the server I was using, so I switched from a library computer to my Mac and it worked just fine! Finding the photos was also a bit of a hassle as I was only searching within the "labelled for reuse" section of Google Images so for some of my searches, the options were pretty limited. This took quite a bit of time, some thorough searching and changing up the way I phrased my request. The last problem that I ran into was when I would try to enter an automatic passage through the text, it would create a failed link. As a result of this, I tried starting over completely a couple of times. Eventually, I found a forum where a person was having the same problem and wasn't able to fix it either. So, for the rest of the time creating the story, I just had to click "Add Passage" every time and manually piece them together. Although the forums were helpful, I found that YouTube videos were the most informative way of learning how to navigate Twine. I feel that with the challenges that I ran into, there is no way to address them other than through trial and error. If I could go back to the beginning of that project and suggest some things to myself it would recommend starting with watching a couple YouTube videos first, as their instruction is the most straight forward and easy to follow. In addition to this, I would also suggest avoiding the library computers as that just wasted time and complicated the situation. I think that this project is successful because it is not only an informative, but interactive way of learning about a historical event. The interactive element allows readers more liberty than simple text and is far more amusing. I feel that success in digital archaeology does not have to be based on the complexity of a project or how advanced it is. If it is able to take simple information and transform it into something digital and interactive that enhances the learning experience in any way, then that's a success to me!.    </p>
